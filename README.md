# Xylophone
##Arduino-Assisted Xylophone Player

This contraption was presented as one of the twenty submissions at the Science Hack Day San Francisco 2018 event. It received the People’s Choice Medal award. http://sf.sciencehackday.org/hacks-2018/

## Goal
Build a robotic music machine that plays xylophone, drinking glasses, or drums, to help solo singers and instrument players. Make it Open Source (HW + SW).

## Requirements
Autonomous
Selection of diferent musics
Self-contained
Easy to transport
Easy to use

## Software Used
- Arduino IDE
- C++
- Arduino Servo_PCA9685 library: https://github.com/sumotoy/servo_PCA9685
- Arduino Wire library

## Hardware Used
- ESP8266
- Adafruit 16-Channel, 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver, I²C Interface,PCA9685
- 4 TowerPro SG92R micro servo
- 2 plastic chopsticks from a restaurant in Beijing
- Power supply: Input 100-240 VAC, 50/60Hz; Output 5V, 2A

## Possible Improvements
All functionalities accessible from a smartphone app
Add more arms to play more notes simultaneously
Add more arms to play drums, bells, etc., simultaneously
Synchronize with other instruments using MIDI connection
